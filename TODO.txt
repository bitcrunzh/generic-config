Scope to implement
1)  Add configuration field application scope (where it can be applied) - for instance, a configured specific IP-Address
    is likely machine local, hence if generalizing a configuration to share it with others, stripping installation local
    configuration may make sense (unless it is SMT configuring specifically for another installation).
2)  Make configuration values reference values from environment variables or possibly other system information.
3)  Make configuration default values optionally dynamically assigned - applying a lookup implementation, for instance
    searching for a COM-Port matching a pattern etc. (Not possible to normalize to JSON and XML).
    Likewise, add a temporary list of installation contextual valid values (which is not used for general
    cross-installation validation), such as current local IP Addresses or available COM-Ports etc.
